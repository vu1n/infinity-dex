# Infinity DEX Release Notes

## v0.1.0 - Core Services Implementation

This release introduces the core service architecture for the Infinity DEX project, providing the foundation for a multichain decentralized exchange leveraging Universal.xyz.

### New Features

#### Service Architecture
- **Types Package**: Created to avoid circular dependencies between services and interfaces
- **Service Factory**: Centralized management of all services with test data initialization
- **Service Interfaces**: Defined clear interfaces for all services to ensure proper abstraction

#### Core Services
- **TokenService**: Management of tokens and token pairs across multiple chains
- **TransactionService**: Tracking and querying of transactions with workflow support
- **LiquidityService**: Management of liquidity pools, positions, and statistics
- **SwapService**: Token swap functionality with quotes, execution, and status tracking
- **ChainService**: Blockchain operations and status monitoring

#### Universal SDK Integration
- Updated the Universal SDK to use the new types package
- Implemented mock SDK for testing with configurable latency and failure rates

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed slice bounds error in SwapService's ExecuteSwap method
- Resolved circular dependency issues between services and interfaces
- Fixed test failures in TestSimpleServiceFactory

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all services
- Implemented test utilities for service testing
- All tests passing with proper error handling

### Next Steps
- Implement API endpoints for frontend integration
- Connect services to Temporal workflows for complex operations
- Implement a real Universal SDK integration
- Enhance frontend components to interact with the services
